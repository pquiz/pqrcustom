# Vaadin Core Elements

[Vaadin elements](https://vaadin.com/elements) are an evolving set of open sourced custom HTML elements, which seamlessly extend the [Polymer Element Catalog](https://elements.polymer-project.org) with high-quality user interface components commonly needed in modern mobile and desktop business web applications.

Vaadin Core Elements is a bundle that contains all the free elements, licensed under the Apache License 2.0. In addition, we have commercially licensed elements, such as [Vaadin Charts](https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-charts).
